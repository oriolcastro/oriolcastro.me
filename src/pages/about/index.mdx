My name is Oriol Casto Arnau and I'm a front-end developer living in a beautiful Mediterranean small city called Vilanova i la Geltrú near Barcelona and fully connected to the world.

I have been always interested in everything related to technology and how it can change the way we live. Three years ago I decided to make a turn in my career and become a full-time professional developer.

These are the beacons that led me, and still do, through my journey.

### Make it easy

The understanding of how things work and the desire to find the best possible solution to a problem is a great fuel for exploration. That's why I became an engineer.

- Master's Degree in Aerospace Science and Technology 2011 - 2014
- Aeronautical Technical Engineering esp. Aircraft navigation 2005 - 2009

After college and reflecting on where my path was leading me I decided to make a 42-degree turn and become a web developer. I consider myself a product-centric engineer so it made sense to put the focus in the web dev area closer to the final user, the _front-end_. With dedication and thanks to the vast online resources available nowadays I have been able to grow my knowledge stack:

- The ecosystem of [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org) and the component-based aproach to build web applications.
- Metaframeworks like [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the architecture of modern web.
- Client-server communication using both REST and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs for the data layer.
- _Responsive_ and _mobile-first_ design using pure CSS, libraries like [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) or [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), or developing a custom components library using [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [Styled System.](https://styled-system.com/)

### Do it together

Aside of developing a carrer I have always considered that as a citizen is very important to be involved in some form of social activism.
From my time in the _free time educational movement (Esplais)_ with [Drac Màgic](http://dracmagic.org/) first and as part of the board of [Esplais Catalans](http://esplac.cat/) later, and also as an active member of [La Unió Vilanovina](http://www.launiovilanovina.cat/) I have achieved some key abilities that I use now in my professional career.

- The **teamwork** spirit as a must.
- The ability to **communicate effectively**.
- The tools for an **effective leadership**.
- The importance of **commitment** and to **bond** with the project.

### Do it right!

At the moment I don't take freelancing projects in [OK! Studio](https://www.okstudio.tech/) as I'm working full time in [Xceed](https://xceed.me).
