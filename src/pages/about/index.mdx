My name is Oriol Casto Arnau, but you can call me Oriol or just Uri for short. I'm a front-end developer living in a beautiful Mediterranean small city called Vilanova i la Geltrú near Barcelona and fully connected to the world.

In 2017 I decided to make a turn in my career and become a full-time professional developer. I have always been interested in everything related to technology and how it could change our lives.

Since then I have worked first as a part-time freelancer while leveling up my skills, then at [Xceed](https://xceed.me/) and now I'm a front-end developr at [Immfly](https://immfly.com/). I consider myself a product-centric engineer, I thrive when outlining, architecting, and developing enjoyable and crafted products that scale.

Always willing to learn new things.

These are the beacons that led me, and still do, through my journey.

### Make it easier

The understanding of how things work and the desire to find the best possible solution to a problem is a great fuel for exploration. That's why I became an engineer.

- Master's Degree in Aerospace Science and Technology 2011 - 2014
- Aeronautical Technical Engineering esp. Aircraft navigation 2005 - 2009

After college and reflecting on where my path was leading me I decided to make a 42-degree turn and become a web developer. As I consider myself a product-centric engineer it made sense to put the focus in the web dev area closer to the final user, the _front-end_. With dedication and thanks to the vast online resources available nowadays I have been able to grow my knowledge stack.

### Do it right

I'm not a _fanboy_ of any particular stack as I tend to consider all technologies as just tools for the job. For each project, I try to select the best set of tools considering the developer experience, the existing community, and the expertise level of myself and the rest of the team.

These are some of the tools I carry in my toolbox:

- [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org), it's ecosystem and the component-based aproach to build web applications.
- Server and UI state management using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Context + Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) or [React-Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).
- The modern web with some of the new metaframeworks like [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- Client-server communication using both REST and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs for the data layer.
- _Responsive_ and _mobile-first_ design using pure CSS, libraries like [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) or [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), or developing a custom components library using [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [Styled System.](https://styled-system.com/)

### Achieve it together!

Aside of developing a carrer I have always considered that as a citizen is very important to be involved in some form of social activism.
From my time in the _free time educational movement (Esplais)_ with [Drac Màgic](http://dracmagic.org/) first and as part of the board of [Esplais Catalans](http://esplac.cat/) later, and also as an active member of [La Unió Vilanovina](http://www.launiovilanovina.cat/) I have achieved some key abilities that I use now in my professional career.

- The **teamwork** spirit as a must.
- The ability to **communicate effectively**.
- The tools for an **effective leadership**.
- The importance of **commitment** and to **bond** with the project.
